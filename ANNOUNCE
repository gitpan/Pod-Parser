   THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!

Do s/parrot/package/g and you know the status of this distribution.
The current version 1.37 has been provided to fix a number of bugs
and integrate a bunch of useful enhancements, which were provided as
patches, thanks to the contributers.

But: There is Pod::Simple, which provides a much better and robust parser,
as well as Unicode support and a lot of other useful things. When thinking
POD, please (start to) think Pod::Simple!

Some of the other modules bundled here (Pod::Usage, Pod::Find etc.) may
appear soon in other distributions, as soon as they are ported away from
Pod::Parser.
